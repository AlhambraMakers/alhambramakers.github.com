My name is Simar. I'm an engineering student, gamer and a [FOSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) enthusiast.

I'm currently in my 4th year of Computer Engineering degree (Class of 2016) at the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca). I'm specializing in the following areas:

* Embedded Design
* Distributed Computing
* Scalable Computing
* Systems Security

Besides the nerdy stuff, I also enjoy the following:

* TV Shows (Most recently watched: [The Man in the High Castle] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740299/))
* Creating EDM ([SoundCloud] (https://soundcloud.com/simar7))

I'm currently **available** for hire starting in April 2016. Here's a [list] (/explist) of companies I've worked at before. My detailed resume is available upon [request] (mailto:simar@linux.com?subject=Resume Request).
