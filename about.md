My name is Simar. I'm an engineering student, podcaster and a [FOSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) enthusiast.

I graduated from the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca) (Class of 2016) in Computer Engineering. I specialize in the following areas:

* Embedded Design
* Distributed Computing
* Systems Security
* Computer Architecture

Besides my day job, I mix tracks for fun. I currently run the following podcasts available publicly on mainstream media:

* Focus Sessions - A monthly podcast featuring the world's finest music to get in the zone.

I'm currently **working** as a Systems Software Engineer at [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/) in Vancouver, BC. I write production level code that helps us resolve your DNS queries. Here's a [list] (http://simar7.github.io/explist/) of companies I've worked at before. My detailed resume is available upon [request](mailto:simar@linux.com?subject=Resume-Request).
