Here's a list of projects I'm currently working on. If you would like to contribute to any of these, feel free to either [email] (mailto:simar@linux.com) or send me a Pull Request with your patch on github and I'll look into it.

### Active Projects

* **singh-kernel** [hammerhead] (https://github.com/simar7/singh-kernel-hammerhead) and [shamu] (https://github.com/simar7/singh-kernel-shamu)   
singh-kernel is my implementation of making a custom kernel for the Android Nexus device line. My work mostly involves backporting patches from either [mainline arm tree] (http://ftp.arm.linux.org.uk/cgit/linux-arm.git) or sideporting from other developers out there.

* **[gitty] (https://github.com/engineeringX/gitty)**    
gitty is an Android app that lets you compete with your friends on GitHub.

* **[mozharness] (https://github.com/mozilla/build-mozharness)**    
mozharness is a python harness that can be used to automate testing.

### Latent Projects
(I don't work on these unless I need to use them)

* **[singh-ramdisk] (https://github.com/simar7/singh-ramdisk)**    
A ramdisk image built on top of Google sources. Mostly still stock due to the lack of time.

* **[kernel-tools] (https://github.com/simar7/kernel-tools)**    
Kernel dev tools collected from the internet.

### Retired Projects
* **[iTerm2NB] (https://github.com/simar7/iTerm2)**    
iTerm2NB is a modification to the open sourced [iTerm] (http://iterm2.com/) software with a borderless interface (hence the postfix NB).

* **[powerline] (https://github.com/simar7/powerline)**     
powerline is a neater way to display useful info on the terminal. This is my local fork of the upstream repo.

* **[tmux-for-mac-powerline] (https://github.com/simar7/tmux-for-mac-powerline)**     
Some of my work in implementing tmux to run nicely alongwith powerline on Macintosh machines.

* **[networking-python] (https://github.com/simar7/networking-python)**    
networking-python is a network simulator written in purely in python. It simulates CSMA/CD and Ethernet networks.

* **[digital-design-vhdl] (https://github.com/simar7/digital-design-vhdl)**     
digital-design-vhdl is a bunch of hardware componenets written in VHDL. These include some math utilties like the ALU and shift reg, a heating system state machine and a full-blown Kirsch Edge detector system.

* **[yocto-project] (https://github.com/simar7/yocto-project)**    
I've worked on Yocto quite a lot so it's hard to describe in a few sentences. Most of my work was on the BeagleBoard BSP and Raspberry Pi integration work. Some parts also involved working with oVirt and QEMU work.

* **[firmware-hackery] (https://github.com/simar7/firmware-hackery)**    
Some of the reverse engineering binary blobs of firmware found on the internet. I do this purely for fun and educational purposes; the rights are reserved for the copyright owners.
