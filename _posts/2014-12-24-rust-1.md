title: Introduction to Rust (Part I) 
---

Rust is a new language being developed at [Mozilla Research Labs] (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/research/projects/). In this post I'll cover some background as to why the new language is being developed. The post will only cover a high level overview without going into the specifics.

### Objective
Rust is being developed as a systems programming language. The language is built on the principles of elimination data races, avoiding memory leaks and at the same time still being fast enough.

### Why Rust?
Most current languages only are able to give you one out of the two characteristics:

* Control
* Safety

Languages like C/C++ give you a lot of control over the code you write. You are able to optimize the code the way you want, for the hardware that you want for. Many language and hardware specifics are possible to be performed using these languages (e.g. volatile memory) but they come at a cost; less safety.

Rust on the other hand promises both. This is done by the implementation of the following ideas:

* **Ownership**
<p>Rust defines ownership of an object in a way that there is memory safety still ensured without a garbage collector having to take care of such tasks.
</p>

* **Borrowing**
<p> Rust has the concept of borrowing. At the time of writing this post I'm not fully aware of the lower level implementation but on a higher level the idea is that to enable resource sharing between threads, Rust has the idea of letting other threads **borrow** resources from a owner thread and return back when done. In this way the *arc* or the automatically reference counting will ensure that at the end there is a balance between the alloc/dealloc's and the net count is zero.
</p>

* **Unsafe code**
<p> Although not encouraged, rust still has the option for developers to write unsafe code from other languages like C/C++ within rust. This is done in order to facilitate any language specific features that you as a developer think are safe and would benefit perf over code quality and aesthetics. In this case, the reliability and functionality of the code rests with the author.
</p>

### Try Rust

You can try rust online [PlayPen] (http://play.rust-lang.org/). Other alternative to try in a browser is [here] (http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_rust_online.php).

### Community

Rust has an extensive community available:

* IRC: irc.mozilla.org at channel [#rust] (https://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust)
* [Mailing List] (https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/rust-dev)
* [GitHub] (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)
