### Motivation

Recently, I've been using mosh everywhere I work. Unfortunately
some systems like my university refuse to upgrade to newer and better
technolgies in favor of enhancing the school's security.

I had a tough time adjusting to broken ssh pipes every time I would
move class rooms but I finally got a work-around that seems stable enough.


### What's needed for the magic?

* {% highlight c %} autossh {% endhighlight %}    
This a daemon that runs on your local machine and keeps a monitor open on a network port. Upon
the detection of dead SSH tunnels, it saves the last known state and tries to reconnect when
network connecitivity is available again.
{% highlight c %}
autossh -M 20000 -f -N serverName -u userName
{% endhighlight %}

* {% highlight c %} screen {% endhighlight %}     
screen is not new to me, infact I used to use it heavily before using to tmux. I've recently
found an extremely light weight config on the interwebs. [Here's](https://github.com/simar7/dotconfigs/blob/0a5488806fcb8b2eff5befab89f64052048a8706/screen/.screenrc)  a link to my customized fork of it.
