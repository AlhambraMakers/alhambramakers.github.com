jornada sobre python que se resolverá este código:

{% highlight python %}
def reverseList(aList):
    if len(aList) <= 1:
        result = aList
    else:
        result = reverseList(aList[1:]) + [aList[0]]
    print(result)
    return result

aList = input("Please enter a list: ")
result = reverseList(aList)
print("Your reversed list is: {}".format(result))
{% endhighlight %}

My best guess after trying this out in both python 3 and python 2.7 environments is that
the behaviour of the <code>input()</code> has changed since between the revisions. My guess
again behind the change makes me think it was done to make people write better and more robust
code as most security based attacks happen by parsing non sanitized input from <code>stdin</code>.
